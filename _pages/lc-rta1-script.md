> 🎨 [**Artist Note:**] Arkham by Night is intended to be designed and laid out as a regular comic book. It will initially be offered for online distribution, but eventually will probably be printed as well; therefore any artwork needs to be at high-enough resolution to support offline printing (presumably 600dpi black & white artwork at normal comic-book size).

> 🎨 [**Artist Note:**] _The general style of Lovecraft Country_—Arkham by Night should be realistic and historical. We're not going for either super-hero artwork, nor particularly stylized artwork (though the artwork should be just a little dark and gloomy).

> 🎨 [**Artist Note:**] The comic is set in the summer of 1933, and thus clothes, buildings, automobiles, and other items all need to be appropriate for the era. The comic is ultimately horror, but the horror is intended to be in the background; thus the artwork can be gloomy, dark, and dangerous, but not horrific except for in the very rare occasions that it's called for. There aren't deep ones and star spawn lurking around this Arkham; instead, we have secrets in the shadows.
