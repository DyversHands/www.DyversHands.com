## Older Games

## Gate Watch: 1st Edition (2019)

The original 18-card version of [Gate Watch](./GateWatch), successfully Kickstarted in 2019.


## Monster Smash: The Next Page (2001)

Where Play-Doh creatures grow fangs, legs, wings, tentacles, poison stings & more, and players compete for the right to smash them. My goal was to just to see how simple and elegant I could make a board game. All the rules, table of costs for the "monster parts," a monster tracking sheet, and even the ruler needed for range attacks, all fit on a single sheet of paper.
