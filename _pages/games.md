# CURRENT GAMES

## ***Tableau Games:*** **Collaborative Cinematic Storytelling**

_**Now Available:** After a [successful Kickstarter](/news/Tableau-Kickstarter-Success/) campaign, our first three Tableau playsets are now available to the public. For more details see [NEWS: Tableau Game System - Now Available to All Storytellers!](/news/Tableau-Now_Available_to_All/)._

***Tableau Games*** invites you to a collaborative, cinematic storytelling experience for 2-5 players ages 14 and up. Within a typical playtime of 2-3 hours, you'll use engaging rule cards, story prompts, and inspirational imagery to craft narratives instead of merely playing a game. Each playset deck caters to various genre and theme combinations, requiring only index cards, paper sheets, markers, and an optional six-sided dice. Each session of ***Tableau*** ushers you into a new realm of creativity, where the potential for unforgettable tales is limitless. *The best stories are the ones we tell together!*

## OLDER GAMES

### Gate Watch: 1st Edition (2019)

The original 18-card version of [Gate Watch](/games/gatewatch2019/), successfully Kickstarted in 2019.

### Monster Smash: The Next Page (2001)

Where Play-Doh creatures grow fangs, legs, wings, tentacles, poison stings & more, and players compete for the right to smash them. My goal was to just to see how simple and elegant I could make a board game. All the rules, table of costs for the "monster parts," a monster tracking sheet, and even the ruler needed for range attacks, all fit on a single sheet of paper.
