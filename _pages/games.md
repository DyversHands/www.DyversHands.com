# CURRENT GAMES

## Tableau

***Collaborative Cinematic Storytelling***

***Tableau*** is a GMless storytelling game system for 2-5 players, played using poker-sized cards featuring rules & inspirational images. Each playset includes everything you need to play except for your own index cards, markers and sheets of paper, and optionally one six-sided dice. The typical playtime is 2-3 hours. Twilight Roadüõ£Ô∏è  & Gate Watchüö™ cards may be mixed & matched with each other and with future Tableau Games playsets.

Tableau helps you create a satisfying cinematic storytelling experience over the course of just a few hours.
* Together you will build an intriguing & impactful story without the need for advance preparation or a designated gamemaster or * narrator.
* The choices of different cards offer you ‚Äúcomposable‚Äù rules, giving you a flexible framework to create and control your characters and explore a range of story genres and play styles.
* Tableau also offers a number of Playsetsüéû that package together specific rules & cards to create specific kinds of stories. Twilight Roadüõ£Ô∏è and Gate Watchüö™  are the first two of a number of Playsetsüéû to come.

> *‚ÄúTableau is a versatile, flexible framework for collaborative storygames grounded deep in the fundamentals of story and character. Mix and match cards to shift what themes, rules, archetypes, and ideas are on the table, helping your group tell a compelling and satisfying story.‚Äù* ‚Äî **Aaron A.

## OLDER GAMES

### Gate Watch: 1st Edition (2019)

The original 18-card version of [Gate Watch](/games/gatewatch2019/), successfully Kickstarted in 2019.

### Monster Smash: The Next Page (2001)

Where Play-Doh creatures grow fangs, legs, wings, tentacles, poison stings & more, and players compete for the right to smash them. My goal was to just to see how simple and elegant I could make a board game. All the rules, table of costs for the "monster parts," a monster tracking sheet, and even the ruler needed for range attacks, all fit on a single sheet of paper.
