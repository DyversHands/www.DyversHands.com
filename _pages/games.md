## ***Tableau Games:*** **Collaborative Cinematic Storytelling**

![Tableau Logo](/assets/images/logos/Tableau_Games_portrait_white_spot_rgb_on_black_190_190.png){: style="float:right; padding:16px;" }

***Tableau Games*** invites you to a collaborative, cinematic storytelling experience for 2-5 players ages 14 and up. Within a typical playtime of 2-3 hours, you'll use engaging rule cards, story prompts, and inspirational imagery to craft narratives instead of merely playing a game. Each playset deck caters to various genre and theme combinations, requiring only index cards, paper sheets, markers, and an optional six-sided dice. Each session of ***Tableau*** ushers you into a new realm of creativity, where the potential for unforgettable tales is limitless. *The best stories are the ones we tell together!*

## OLDER GAMES

### Gate Watch: 1st Edition (2019)

The original 18-card version of [Gate Watch](/games/gatewatch2019/), successfully Kickstarted in 2019.

### Monster Smash: The Next Page (2001)

Where Play-Doh creatures grow fangs, legs, wings, tentacles, poison stings & more, and players compete for the right to smash them. My goal was to just to see how simple and elegant I could make a board game. All the rules, table of costs for the "monster parts," a monster tracking sheet, and even the ruler needed for range attacks, all fit on a single sheet of paper.
