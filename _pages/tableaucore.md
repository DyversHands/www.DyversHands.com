* how to make choices about what story elements to include;
* how to cast your leads;
* how to introduce them with truths and open questions written on index cards;
* how to direct and frame scenes; and the central story mechanics of character moves and drama.

Safety rules with guidelines for respectful play are also included.

We also offer a wide range of _[Booklet Storysets 📖](https://itch.io/physical-games/tag-storyset)_, each curated to inspire your sessions with the additional ingredients for your stories! Additionally, _Tableau Core ꩜ Rules_** **are easily adaptable for use with story elements and characters brought in from _[‘belonging outside belonging‘](https://itch.io/physical-games/tag-belonging-outside-belonging)_ style storygames.

With new _[Booklet Storysets 📖](https://itch.io/physical-games/tag-storyset)_ supplements being made available every month, and _Playsets 🎞️_ like _Lovecraft Country: "A Study in Madness"_ [on the way](https://www.dyvershands.com/Subscribe), there's always more storytelling excitement to explore. It all starts with _**Tableau's**_ vital spark. Let _**Tableau**_Core ꩜ Rules_ ignite your creativity tonight!

## Tableau Booklets

Instead of poker-sized cards, this version of the _Tableau Core ꩜ Rules_ comes in 8 folded _Booklets 📖_ designed for convenience and affordability.  This compact format simplifies setup and portability. Print at home, gather some friends, and you're ready for spontaneous storytelling.  Its compact size also makes it great for travel and conventions. 

Each rulebook page prints single-sided on a standard US Letter 8.5" x 11" paper. Print the pages, make a few origami-inspired folds, and you have _Tableau Core ꩜ Rules_ in the palm of your hand!  This _Tableau Booklet 📖_ format makes setup fast and hassle-free.

**Assembly:** Print booklet, single-sided. Fold long way (11'') with text out, then unfold. Fold short way (8-½'') with text out, then unfold. Fold short sides ¼ and ¾ inward with text in. Cut center guide, stopping at the ¼ & ¾ folds—don’t cut to page’s end. Refold as per image. Ensure cover is on front. Tighten creases. ![Tableau Booklet Assembly Illustration](/assets/images/games/tableau/booklet_assembly_illustration_375 _292.png)[![How to Assemble a Tableau Booklet \[youtube\]](https://img.youtube.com/vi/n5hpg7hOXo4/hqdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/n5hpg7hOXo4){: style="float:left; padding:16px"}

## Tableau _Storyset&nbsp;📖 Booklets_

_**Tableau**_ _Booklet Storysets_&nbsp;📖 ​supplement _**Tableau**_ stories with additional rules and story _Elements_. _Storysets_&nbsp;📖​ also are easy to incorporate into most _[‘belonging outside belonging’](https://itch.io/physical-games/tag-belonging-outside-belonging)​_ style storygames, and are adaptable for use with many other styles of tabletop role-playing games.​​

_Storysets&nbsp;📖_​ don't possess the same flexibility as a _**Tableau**_ card-based _Playset 🎞_. Instead, they are designed for a similar style of play using small, card-sized _Booklets_ easily printed on _US Letter 8½''x11''_ paper. To utilize a _Storyset&nbsp;📖_​ just unfold the _Booklet_ to a particular _Story 📖 Element_ page and have a storyteller _Take Up 🫰_ that _Booklet_ for control that _Element_ just like they would a card with a _Story 📖 Element_.
