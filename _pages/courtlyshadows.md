_**Now Available:** After a [successful Kickstarter](/news/Tableau-Kickstarter-Success/) campaign, our first three Tableau playsets, including **Twilight Road** 🛣, are now available to the public.

In **Courtly Shadows** 👑 honor meets deception, whispered secrets, and hidden agendas. A two-page _Storyset 📖 Booklet_ supplement for [***Tableau:*** _Collaborative Cinematic Storytelling_](https://www.dyvershands.com/games/Tableau/) system available through DriveThruRPG & itch.io as Print'N'Play.

Additionally, adaptable for use in other _[Belonging Outside Belonging](https://itch.io/physical-games/tag-belonging-outside-belonging)​_ style storygames to accentuate tales of aristocracy, concealed motives, and duels of nobility.

Leverage these five pivotal _Story 📖 Elements_ in your stories:

* **Setting**: The _Court 🏘️_: Waltz through an opulent realm of ambition and privilege, where every gesture hides a secret and power ebbs and flows like tides.
* **Tone**: _Intrigue 🎶_: Witness the intricate ballet of deception and hidden motives, as power players navigate the murky waters of politics and strategy.
* **Theme**: _Status 💢_: An environment where your worth is determined by lineage, power, and cunning, where every step up the ladder may cost more than it's worth.
* **Faction**: The _Watch 🫂_: Behind each great court lies an ever-vigilant protector. Stand alongside them as they guard against threats, both overt and concealed.
* **Genre Beats**: _At Dawn 🥁_: As the first light pierces the horizon, watch as destinies are sealed, and the fate of the courtly realm hangs in the balance.

In **Courtly Shadows** 👑, allegiances shift, secrets unravel, and the dawn may herald victory or despair. How will you shape the fate of your realm?

## Tableau _Storyset 📖 Booklets_

_**Tableau**_ _Storyset 📖 Booklets_ ​supplement _**Tableau**_ stories with additional rules and story _Elements_, but you'll require a _Tableau Playset_ or the _Tableau Core Rules_ to play. _Storysets 📖_​ also are easy to incorporate into most _[Belonging Outside Belonging](https://itch.io/physical-games/tag-belonging-outside-belonging)​_ style storygames, and are adaptable for use with many other styles of tabletop role-playing games.​​

_Storysets 📖_​ don't possess the same flexibility as a _**Tableau**_ card-based _Playset 🎞_. Instead, they are designed for a similar style of play using small, card-sized _Booklets_ easily printed on _US Letter 8½''x11''_ paper. To utilize a _Storyset 📖_​ just unfold the _Booklet_ to a particular _Story 📖 Element_ page and have a storyteller _Take Up 🫰_ that _Booklet_ for control that _Element_ just like they would a card with a _Story 📖 Element_. ![Tableau Booklet Assembly Illustration](/assets/images/games/tableau/booklet_assembly_illustration_375 _292.png){: style="float:right; padding:16px"}

**Assembly**: Print booklet, single-sided. Fold long way (11'') with text out, then unfold. Fold short way (8-½'') with text out, then unfold. Fold short sides ¼ and ¾ inward with text in. Cut center guide, stopping at the ¼ & ¾ folds—don’t cut to page‘s end. Refold as per image. Ensure cover is on front. Tighten creases.
