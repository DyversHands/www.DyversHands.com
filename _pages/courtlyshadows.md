_**Now Available:** After a [successful Kickstarter](/news/Tableau-Kickstarter-Success/) campaign, our first three Tableau playsets, including **Twilight Road** ðŸ›£, are now available to the public. For more details see [NEWS: Tableau Game System - Now Available to All Storytellers!](/news/Tableau-Now_Available_to_All/)._

Enter a world where honor meets deception, whispered secrets, and hidden agendas in **Courtly Shadows** &#128081; a two-page **Storyset** &#128214; **Booklet** supplement for ***Tableau* Games*** that accentuates tales of noble duels and concealed motives. Allegiances shift, secrets unravel, and the dawn may herald victory or despair. How will you shape the fate of your realm?

**Tableau Storysets** supplement ***Tableau*** stories with additional rules and story elements, but you'll need to already own a **Tableau Playset** or the _Tableau Core Rules_ to play. **Storysets** also are easy to incorporate into most _Belonging Outside Belonging_ style storygames, and are adaptable for use with many other styles of storygames.
