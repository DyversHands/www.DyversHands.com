![Trials of Tenacity &#127869; Storyset Cover](/assets/images/games/tableau/TrialsOfTenacity/trials_of_tenacity_storyset_cover_375_298.jpg){: style="float:right; padding:16px"}

Endure a world reshaped by calamity in **Trials of Tenacity** 🍽️, a three-page _Storyset 📖 Booklet_ supplement for [***Tableau:*** _Collaborative Cinematic Storytelling_](https://www.dyvershands.com/games/Tableau/).

Also adaptable for use in other ‘belonging outside belonging’ style storygames , this _Storyset 📖_ delves into the struggles and hopes of a desolate landscape where the embers of civilization flicker.

Leverage these eight pivotal _Story 📖 Elements_ in your stories:

* **Setting** _Post-Apocalyptic_ 🏘️: Traverse a scarred world where past civilization's memories are mere shadows in ruins, each breath a testament to survivors' resilience amidst desolation.
* **Genre Beat** _Survival_ 🥁: Dance with danger, feel the raw rhythms of heartbeats in nature's fury, every beat revealing life's fragility and profound insights on the edge of peril.
* **Theme** _Scarcity_ 💢: With abundance a distant memory, dwindling resources become desperate signposts, forcing souls to rethink value and face dire choices.
* **Drama** _Resources_ 🎭: Amid a fragile balance of need and desire, shifting resources dictate destinies, with individuals balancing between bounty and lack.
* **Genre Beat** _Embers of Hope_ 🥁: In despair's thick shadow, we chase faint glimmers of hope, whispers of stories longing to rekindle and tales of resurgence.
* **Theme** _Decay_ 💢: As time tightens its grip, structures fall and nature overpowers, illustrating the ceaseless march of decay and the eerie beauty in nature's reclaim.
* **Tone:** _Grit & Grace_ 🎶: Amidst life's adversities, enduring spirit and poised resilience craft a hopeful ballad, each challenge a prelude to brighter moments.
* **Faction:** _Stewards of Progress_ 🫂: At the crossroads of past and future, these guardians protect knowledge, balancing the urgency of innovation with time-tested wisdom.

In **Trials of Tenacity** 🍽️, resilience battles against time's ravages, hope dances on the knife's edge, and tales of survival intertwine with legends reborn. What stories will you weave from the remnants of a world once lost?

## Tableau _Storyset 📖 Booklets_

_**Tableau**_ _Storyset 📖 Booklets_ ​supplement _**Tableau**_ stories with additional rules and story _Elements_, but you'll require a _Tableau Playset_ or the _Tableau Core Rules_ to play. _Storysets 📖_​ also are easy to incorporate into most _[Belonging Outside Belonging](https://itch.io/physical-games/tag-belonging-outside-belonging)​_ style storygames, and are adaptable for use with many other styles of tabletop role-playing games.​​

_Storysets 📖_​ don't possess the same flexibility as a _**Tableau**_ card-based _Playset 🎞_. Instead, they are designed for a similar style of play using small, card-sized _Booklets_ easily printed on _US Letter 8½''x11''_ paper. To utilize a _Storyset 📖_​ just unfold the _Booklet_ to a particular _Story 📖 Element_ page and have a storyteller _Take Up 🫰_ that _Booklet_ for control that _Element_ just like they would a card with a _Story 📖 Element_. ![Tableau Booklet Assembly Illustration](/assets/images/games/tableau/booklet_assembly_illustration_375 _292.png){: style="float:right; padding:16px"}

**Assembly**: Print booklet, single-sided. Fold long way (11'') with text out, then unfold. Fold short way (8-½'') with text out, then unfold. Fold short sides ¼ and ¾ inward with text in. Cut center guide, stopping at the ¼ & ¾ folds—don’t cut to page‘s end. Refold as per image. Ensure cover is on front. Tighten creases.
