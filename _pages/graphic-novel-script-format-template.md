### 📝 Script Notes

  > 🎨 ARTIST: Maintain realism with subtle surreal cues. Use strong shadows and ambient details to create unease.

  > 🎭 COSTUME: Jane's trench coat should appear increasingly worn through the issue.

  > 📦 PROP: The pendant must always be visible when Jane speaks with the ghost.

  > 🌫️ ATMOSPHERE: A humid, cold quality to all indoor scenes. Mist clings to windows.

  > 📎 REFERENCE: Inspiration for city layout from Fritz Lang's *Metropolis*.

  > 📎 REFERENCE: See aerial image reference: /images/skylines/sample.jpg

## Notes for Graphic Novel Script Writers

1. **Visual Storytelling**: Remember that comics are a visual medium. Show don't tell.
2. **Panel Economy**: Each panel should advance the story or reveal character.
3. **Page Turns**: Use page turns for reveals and cliffhangers.
4. **Dialogue Brevity**: Keep dialogue concise. Comics have limited space.
5. **Artist Collaboration**: Leave room for artist interpretation while being clear about essential elements.
