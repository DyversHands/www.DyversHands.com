  > [📦 Prop Note: The pendant must always be visible when Jane speaks with the ghost.]
  > [🌫️ Atmosphere Note: A humid, cold quality to all indoor scenes. Mist clings to windows.]
  > [🔖 REFERENCE: Inspiration for city layout from Fritz Lang's *Metropolis*.]
  > [🔖 REFERENCE: See aerial image reference: /images/skylines/sample.jpg]
