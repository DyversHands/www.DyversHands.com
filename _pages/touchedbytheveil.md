**Touched by the Veil** 🪦, where the unsolved intertwines with the unseen, setting hearts racing and souls searching.
A two-page _Storyset 📖 Booklet_ supplement for [***Tableau:*** _Collaborative Cinematic Storytelling_](https://www.dyvershands.com/games/Tableau/), and adaptable for use in other ‘belonging outside belonging’ style storygames , this _Storyset 📖_ daccentuates tales of lurking truths, and the irresistible dance between the known and the unknown.

Leverage these quintessential Halloween _Story 📖 Elements_ in your stories:

* **Setting** _The Haunted_ 🏘️: Traverse places where the barrier between worlds is gossamer-thin. Here, every echo holds a story, every shadow might just have a soul.
* **Tone:** _Suspense_ 🎶: Walk the tightrope of anticipation, where every heartbeat might herald a storm, and the unseen and the unsaid loom just out of reach.
* **Theme** _Obsession_ 💢: Delve into fervent passions that defy logic.. When the heart's deepest desires blur with the haunting call of the beyond, what path will you choose?
* **Genre Beat** _Mystery_ 🥁: Embark on a journey to unravel puzzles shrouded in layers of deception. But remember, every clue uncovered may come at a price.
* **Faction:** _Wandering Souls_ 🫂: Encounter the entities of the in-between, those who whisper tales from the yonder, some seeking closure, some yearning for justice, and some guarding age-old truths.

In **Touched by the Veil** 🪦 every decision reverberates with suspense, every passion becomes a binding chain, and every shadow might just hold the key to a mystery unsolved. As the curtain lifts on these tales, how will you navigate the intricate tapestry of intrigue and emotion?

## Tableau _Storyset 📖 Booklets_

_**Tableau**_ _Storyset 📖 Booklets_ ​supplement _**Tableau**_ stories with additional rules and story _Elements_, but you'll require a _Tableau Playset_ or the _Tableau Core Rules_ to play. _Storysets 📖_​ also are easy to incorporate into most _[Belonging Outside Belonging](https://itch.io/physical-games/tag-belonging-outside-belonging)​_ style storygames, and are adaptable for use with many other styles of tabletop role-playing games.​​

_Storysets 📖_​ don't possess the same flexibility as a _**Tableau**_ card-based _Playset 🎞_. Instead, they are designed for a similar style of play using small, card-sized _Booklets_ easily printed on _US Letter 8½''x11''_ paper. To utilize a _Storyset 📖_​ just unfold the _Booklet_ to a particular _Story 📖 Element_ page and have a storyteller _Take Up 🫰_ that _Booklet_ for control that _Element_ just like they would a card with a _Story 📖 Element_. ![Tableau Booklet Assembly Illustration](/assets/images/games/tableau/booklet_assembly_illustration_375 _292.png){: style="float:right; padding:16px"}

**Assembly**: Print booklet, single-sided. Fold long way (11'') with text out, then unfold. Fold short way (8-½'') with text out, then unfold. Fold short sides ¼ and ¾ inward with text in. Cut center guide, stopping at the ¼ & ¾ folds—don’t cut to page‘s end. Refold as per image. Ensure cover is on front. Tighten creases.
