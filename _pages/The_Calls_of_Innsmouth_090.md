# Story Information
synopsis: >
  February 13, 1928. Night telephone operator Claire Palmer connects routine calls 
  in sleepy Arkham—until desperate voices from neighboring Innsmouth break through. 
  Against every rule of her profession, she listens in, discovering a federal raid 
  planned for dawn. As the night deepens, familiar operators at the coastal exchange 
  are replaced by strangers, calls are cut short, and the voices of Innsmouth fade 
  one by one into dead air. By morning, an entire town will vanish, and Claire must 
  choose between her safety and bearing witness to the truth.
logline: "A 1920's telephone operator becomes witness to a town's final hours before federal erasure."
tagline: "Every call carries the weight of history."

### 📝 Script Notes

  > 🎨 ARTIST: Visual style should evoke 1920s noir with Art Deco elements. Heavy use of shadows and limited color palette - primarily blacks, whites, and muted blues/greens. The telephone exchange should feel both safe and claustrophobic.

  > 🌫️ ATMOSPHERE: The story builds from routine professionalism to creeping dread. Each violation of protocol should feel weightier than the last. By the federal takeover, the atmosphere should be suffocating.

  > 🎭 COSTUME: Claire wears professional 1920s operator attire - white blouse, dark skirt, no jewelry. Headset is crucial visual element. Federal agents in period dark suits and fedoras.

  > 📦 PROP: Manual switchboard with vertical panels of jacks, horizontal rows of cords. No dials or numbers - operators connect by name. Small desk lamp provides main lighting.

  > 🔊 SOUND DESIGN: Each type of call should have distinct characteristics - clear local calls, slightly distorted Innsmouth calls, distant/tinny long-distance calls.

  > 📎 REFERENCE: 1920s telephone operator procedures: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjEaH7lqEo

  - **🗣️ CLAIRE (BALLOON):**<br/> Line went dead. Third time this week.

  - **🗣️ LOUISE (BALLOON):**<br/> Should I log it as equipment failure?

#### 🖼️ **PANEL SIX**

  > 🎨 ARTIST: Claire making notes in her personal notepad - not the official log.

  - **🗣️ CLAIRE (BALLOON):**<br/> Yes. Innsmouth line fault. Routine.

## Historical Note

The federal raid on Innsmouth as depicted in H.P. Lovecraft's "The Shadow Over Innsmouth" (1931) was written just three years after the events in this story. Lovecraft claimed his tale was fiction. 

Those who know better remain silent.

The systematic removal of an entire population based on their "difference" would be repeated throughout the 20th century - from the Armenian Genocide to the Holocaust to Japanese-American internment to modern-day raids on immigrant communities. 

The tools change. The fear remains the same.

And somewhere, someone is always listening.
