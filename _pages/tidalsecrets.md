Dive into the abyss of _**Lovecraft Country:**_ **Tidal Secrets**&nbsp;⚓️ where ancient tales meld with the ocean’s roar, guiding the curious and ensnaring the unwary. A two-page _Booklet Storyset_&nbsp;📚 supplement for [***Tableau:*** _Collaborative Cinematic Storytelling_](https://www.dyvershands.com/games/Tableau/) system available through DriveThruRPG & itch.io as Print'N'Play.

Additionally, adaptable for use in other _[Belonging Outside Belonging](https://itch.io/physical-games/tag-belonging-outside-belonging)​_ style storygames to amplify narratives that blend seafaring lore, coastal enigmas, and the inexorable pull of the shadows of family history.

Anchor your tales with these five maritime _Story&nbsp;📖 Elements&nbsp;☯_ in your stories:

* **Setting**: The _Lovecraft Country&nbsp;🏘️_: Venture through a land haunted by its own myths. Here, every wind whispers an old tale, every creak could be a beckoning from the deep.
* **Setting**: The _Innsmouth&nbsp;🏘️_: Etched by time and tides, this quaint seafaring village echoes with the breath of the sea. Tradition seeps through its winding cobblestone streets, aged houses, and salt-encrusted boats, crafting a rhythm of life as enduring as the sea’s tides.
* **Theme**: _Family of Origin&nbsp;💢_: Dive deep into the heart of relationships, where every shared memory might be a treasure and every secret, a potential tempest.
* **Genre Beats**: _Generations&nbsp;🥁_: Embark on an odyssey through time, witnessing the rise and ebb of a family's legacy. But be wary, for every era brings its own trials.
* **Faction**: The _Kin of the Deep&nbsp;🫂_: Engage with the veiled guardians of the abyss. Some seek to preserve age-old rituals, some long for transformation, while others guard their secrets with a fierce determination.

In **Tidal Secrets**&nbsp;⚓️, every decision ripples with the ocean's might, every bond can anchor or set free, and every legend might just reveal a truth waiting to surface. As the tide rises and falls on these stories, how will you navigate the waves of mystery and legacy?

We hope this **Storyset**&nbsp;📚 inspires you to [signup](https://www.dyvershands.com/Subscribe) for future _**Lovecraft Country**_ **Playsets**&nbsp;🎞️ and **Storysets**&nbsp;📚.

## _Tableau_ Booklet Storysets&nbsp;📚

_**Tableau**_ _Booklet Storysets_&nbsp;📚 ​supplement _**Tableau**_ stories with additional rules and story _Elements_&nbsp;☯, but you'll require a _Tableau Playset_ or the _Tableau Core Rules_ to play. _Storysets&nbsp;📚_​ also are easy to incorporate into most _[Belonging Outside Belonging](https://itch.io/physical-games/tag-belonging-outside-belonging)​_ style storygames, and are adaptable for use with many other styles of tabletop role-playing games.​​

_Storysets_&nbsp;📚 don't possess the same flexibility as a _**Tableau**_ card-based _Playset&nbsp;🎞_. Instead, they are designed for a similar style of play using small, card-sized _Booklets_ easily printed on _US Letter 8½''x11''_ paper. To utilize a _Storysets_&nbsp;📚​ just unfold the _Booklet_ to a particular _Story&nbsp;📖 Element_ page and have a storyteller _Take Up&nbsp;🫰_ that _Booklet_ for control that _Element_ just like they would a card with a _Story&nbsp;📖 Element_. ![Tableau Booklet Assembly Illustration](/assets/images/games/tableau/booklet_assembly_illustration_375_292.png){: style="float:right; padding:16px"}

**Assembly:** Print booklet, single-sided. Fold long way (11'') with text out, then unfold. Fold short way (8-½'') with text out, then unfold. Fold short sides ¼ and ¾ inward with text in. Cut center guide, stopping at the ¼ & ¾ folds—don’t cut to page’s end. Refold as per image. Ensure cover is on front. Tighten creases.
