# Tableau Games

**Kickstarter Campaign:** Our Kickstarter campaign for the first two ***Tableau*** playsets was a success. See [News](/news/Tableau-Kickstarter-Success/).{: .notice--success}

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWMsySbdm_0"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/eWMsySbdm_0/mqdefault.jpg" style="float: right; border: 2px solid blue; margin-left: 5px"></a> ***Tableau*** is a storytelling game system that emphasizes collaborative storytelling and character development. The game's mechanics are designed to be flexible, allowing players to create stories in just a few hours from a wide variety of genres and styles without the need for advanced preparation or a designated game master.

***Tableau*** consists of a set of rules cards and a variety of story cards that establish themes, moods, settings, and character traits. Players use these cards to collaboratively create a story, with each scene focusing on a single question and building toward a satisfying cinematic narrative.

The system is designed to be approachable for players of all skill levels and encourages creativity and player agency. Tableau is ideal for players who enjoy immersive role-playing and narrative-focused gameplay.

Whether you are a seasoned RPG veteran or a newcomer to tabletop gaming, Tableau is a great choice for anyone looking to tell their own stories in a collaborative and engaging way.
