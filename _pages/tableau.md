## Tableau

Tableau is a storytelling game system that emphasizes collaborative storytelling and character development. The game's mechanics are designed to be flexible, allowing players to create stories in just a few hours from a wide variety of genres and styles without the need for advanced preparation or a designated game master.

Tableau consists of a set of rules cards and a variety of story cards that establish themes, moods, settings, and character traits. Players use these cards to collaboratively create a story, with each scene focusing on a single question and building toward a satisfying cinematic narrative.

The system is designed to be approachable for players of all skill levels and encourages creativity and player agency. Tableau is ideal for players who enjoy immersive role-playing and narrative-focused gameplay.

Whether you are a seasoned RPG veteran or a newcomer to tabletop gaming, Tableau is a great choice for anyone looking to tell their own stories in a collaborative and engaging way.

### Reviewer Quotes

> *“Tableau is a versatile, flexible framework for collaborative storygames grounded deep in the fundamentals of story and character. Mix and match cards to shift what themes, rules, archetypes, and ideas are on the table, helping your group tell a compelling and satisfying story.”* — **Aaron A. Reed, author of the [Archives of the Sky](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1850151847/archives-of-the-sky-epic-sci-fi-roleplaying) story game.**

> *“Gate Watch is an intriguing, distilled world-crafting, story-telling, and role-playing experience in the guise of a simple game. I wouldn't be surprised if some of the principles it is based on are used in basic literary, plot-writing or directing courses. Involve everybody around the table and collaboratively set the background through a pool of questions. Create exciting scenes involving both the background and the participating characters with nothing but narration. Dice? Nah, too random. Cards? Yes, but only a handful. Rules? Less than a single page. Duration? As long as you wish. Fun? Loads! The game can explore any setting and genre you want it to, with everybody simultaneously starring and directing. Veteran gamer? Hardcore role-player? Total newbie? It doesn't matter. All you need is a vivid imagination.”* **— Antonios S, RPGnet Reviewer & Columnist (about the 1st edition of Gate Watch).**

### About the Gate Watch🚪 Playset🎞

Gate Watch🚪 -  A Playset for Tableau

Cover Card: Gate Watch🚪 Playset

You and your companions are members of the Gate Watch – charged to monitor the border between realms.

Who built The Gate? What is on the other side? Why are you watching? What are you guarding against?

These are the questions you will answer as you explore the Enigma that is The Gate. Every game session is different, every world, every gate unique.

### Overview of Play

There is only one rule required for the game, Tableau Core ꩜, which is described on three poker-sized cards:

Rule Card: Tableau Core ꩜ 1
Rule Card: Tableau Core ꩜ 2
Core Rule Card: Tableau Core ꩜ 3

After review of these Core ꩜ rules, the players will either choose a pre-defined Playset 🎞 of cards that works well together or combine specific Rules 📜 cards to define the mechanics of collaborative storytelling, Story 📖 cards to describe the elements of the narrative, and optional Character Traits 👤 to create unique and complex characters.

Here is an example of a specific Rule 📜 that might be placed on the table: Drama Tokens 🎭 , where the storytellers do not use dice for tension, but instead use a form of good & bad karma to balance the different Moves available to Lead characters. But the storytellers might instead have chosen the Declare 🎭  or the  Push 🎭 card, which uses dice to determine outcomes and is useful for different kinds of stories.

Rule 📜 card: Drama Tokens 🎭 (from the Twilight Road Playset)

During the game, most selected Rules 📜 will stay on the table, but some will be taken up and held by the storytellers. Typically each storyteller will have four cards in their hand, such as:

An Example of a Storyteller's Hand of Cards (from the Twilight Road 🛣️ Playset)

A Player Role 🗣, such as The Director 🗣, who is used in GMless-style games, or The Narrator 🗣, who is a storyteller with a unique perspective or a player who has been given narrative authority for a full act or a session. These are the most common Player Roles 🗣, but there are others such as The Spotlight 🗣 or this optional one: The Mapper 🗣, who is used in both Twilight Road and Gate Watch.

Player Role 🗣 card: The Mapper

A Story 📖 card that gives a storyteller authority over an element in this story. (This one is from Twilight Road 🚪 but could be chosen by the storytellers for any story):

Story Setting 🏘️ Card: The Road (from Twilight Road Playset)

One or more of Character Trait 👤 cards to help define the unique character that a storyteller portrays. This one is Charming, an Approach 🛠 from Twilight Road 🚪 but it can used as Character Trait 👤 in other stories:

Here is an example of a second Character Traits 👤. This one is a Face 🧑🏼‍🦲, which it is an archetype associated with a particular type of story. This one is The Runaway 🧑🏼‍🦲 from Twilight Road 🚪, but like all the other cards, could be used in other Tableau games.

Storytellers can have a huge numbers of options available for play in the game, but they will only use a few during any scene in the story. 

Here is a video (14m) that offers an overview of the Twilight Road 🛣 Playset 🎞.

### Types of Stories

Tableau inspires players to be creative, supporting a nearly infinite variety of potential stories.

Thus far in play-testing the Twilight Road 🛣 Playset 🎞, the cards collaboratively selected by storytellers resulted in a wide variety of settings & genres:

* a historical fantasy, where a river journey across the Viking lands of ancient Russian followed the trail of Uncle Ingvar, lost while he was searching for the Silk Road and a lost city and treasure;
* a 90s paranormal fantasy, in which a spring-break car trip led free-spirited students across America, each trying to find a lost icon on Route 66, looking for answers to a secret in their family history.

Thus far in play-testing the Gate Watch 🚪 Playset 🎞, games have included:

* a classics fantasy, with the gate lying between the real-world and the Greek heaven & hell, and Watchers possibly hired by Charon;
* a 1950's noir mystery, featuring the gate between a Hollywood producer's mansion and the hardscrabble blue-collar world of post-war Los Angeles;
* a sci-fi adventure, where a collapsing underground mutant civilization had a hidden exit to a post-apocalyptic landscape;
* a wacky parallel universe, home of mechano-electro elves, who had discovered a gate to our reality at a California game convention, full of people who didn't understand them.

A game using storytelling cards from both Playsets 🎞 was:

* a dark historical fantasy, where a water well located in a German farming village at the end of WWII was the only escape from invading Russians, but led the villagers into a perilous journey through the lands of the fae, with no way home.

We've found the mechanics of Tableau work well for experienced gamers as well as those who are completely new to collaborative story games. From improv actors to experienced role players, a wide range of people have found the instructions and mechanisms easy to understand and fun to play. The resulting stories were imaginative, the settings and genres intriguing, the play dynamic, and most importantly, all had a satisfying ending in just a couple of hours of play. Tableau is a fun evening's entertainment.

### Quickstarter

This will be my second “Quickstarter” — the previous being the first edition of Gate Watch, which was was a success on Kickstarter in 2019. 

I love the creative power of constraints, so like last time, I am attempting to embraces the following ethos:

* Quickstarter is about thinking small and simple.
* Quickstarter is keeping it fun & "Do It Yourself".
* Quickstarter doesn't take over your life and is not a job.

To this end, I am following these Quickstarter Rules:

* Plan it in three months or less.
* Campaign for less than 20 days.
* Funding goal under $1,000.
* Rewards under $50.
* A short & sweet video or none at all.
* No PR or media outreach (unless contacted).
* No paid ads on social media.
* No stretch goals.
* Ship quickly.
* Keeping the Price Low, the Shipping Simple

### Fulfilled by DriveThruCards

Also in the spirit of a Quickstarter, this game consists of just poker-sized cards in a simple tuckbox, delivered PoD ("Print-On-Demand") by DriveThruCards. This allows me to offer a full game to my US customers for under $20 for Gate Watch, under $25 for Twilight Road, or under $38 for both!

As before, your pledge here on Kickstarter is only a partial payment that gets you a code to order from DriveThruCards At-Cost (meaning at the printer actual cost for printing, currently ~$8.17 for Gate Watch, or ~$10.27 for Twilight Road) plus your Shipping Fee. You'll pay this to DriveThruCards after you receive the discount code, so that you can handle your own shipping and address information at that time.

In the US, shipping is ~$5.00 for Gate Watch, or ~$6 for Twilight Road, but only ~$6 for both! However, if you're somewhere outside the US, shipping is more expensive. In Canada it starts at $12 and it only goes up from there. See the DriveThuCards Estimated Shipping Costs page for more information. 

Table: Kickstarter Cost + DriveThruCards "At Cost" + US Shipping = Total Price
The advantage of this approach is that it allows this Kickstarter to be lean, quick, and simple, so that I can easily offer more story games like this in the future. It also has the added benefit that I don't have to inflate the prices to cover any potential production or postage hikes, so I can offer the best possible price!

### $5,000 Stretch Goal:Tableau text & templates available CC-BY-SA as a Free Cultural Work!

Free Cultural Work 1.1

I am going to break one of the above Quickstarter rules. However, I believe doing so  still meets the spirit of of a Quickstarter. There is one, and only one Stretch Goal:

If this Kickstarter receives pledges in excess of $5,000, I will make this entire Tableau game system and both of these Playsets available under the Creative Commons — Attribution-ShareAlike License, aka CC BY-SA 3.0, making it a Free Cultural Work. I will make the Tableau trademark free-to-use if you agree not to infringe on other peoples' intellectural properties (e.g. no Star Wars playsets unless you have permission!). I will make all of my templates for both the cards and the DriveThruCards tuckboxes available as well, in an easy-to-use Apple Pages and Apple Keynote format (though feel free to create your own templates!)

What does this mean? It means that anyone can make their own Tableau cards, do their own Quickstarters, sell their own Playsets 🎞 deck designs, and innovate new storytelling game designs based on these rules, provided that they give credit and share their own work to the community in the same way. I hope that together we can create a movement toward a new style of collaborative storytelling play!

### Risks and challenges

Every Kickstarter has its risks, but I've designed mine to keep those risks to a minimum. I have also been involved with a number of other game & book related Kickstarters, and this is my second Kickstarter of this type of game, so I have a good understanding of the challenges.  Both Playsets are already written & complete, have been playtested with both roleplayers and non-roleplayers, and only need final editing and fine-tuning. The card and tuckbox design has been polished & tested with trial runs.  The cards will be produced by PoD publisher DriveThruCards, who has a fully automated production cycle, from digital design to manufacture of packaged decks of cards, and has been delivering cards and games for many years. All that is left to do at the end of this Kickstarter is for me to give DriveThruCards your email address; they will send you a code to redeem the physical cards, and you pay them directly for the actual printing & shipping.  I've believe that I have anticipated everything I can, and kept everything as simple as possible. This campaign is low enough in budget and I have enough contingency both in terms of time and funds, that I'm confident that I can cope with any unforeseen challenges.
