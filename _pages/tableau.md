## Tableau

***Collaborative Cinematic Storytelling***

***Tableau*** is a GMless storytelling game system for 2-5 players, played using poker-sized cards featuring rules & inspirational images. Each playset includes everything you need to play except for your own index cards, markers and sheets of paper, and optionally one six-sided dice. The typical playtime is 2-3 hours. Twilight Roadüõ£Ô∏è  & Gate Watchüö™ cards may be mixed & matched with each other and with future Tableau Games playsets.

Tableau helps you create a satisfying cinematic storytelling experience over the course of just a few hours.
* Together you will build an intriguing & impactful story without the need for advance preparation or a designated gamemaster or * narrator.
* The choices of different cards offer you ‚Äúcomposable‚Äù rules, giving you a flexible framework to create and control your characters and explore a range of story genres and play styles.
* Tableau also offers a number of Playsets üéû that package together specific rules & cards to create specific kinds of stories. Twilight Road¬†üõ£Ô∏è and Gate Watch¬†üö™  are the first two of a number of Playsets üéû to come.

### Reviewer Quotes

> *‚ÄúTableau is a versatile, flexible framework for collaborative storygames grounded deep in the fundamentals of story and character. Mix and match cards to shift what themes, rules, archetypes, and ideas are on the table, helping your group tell a compelling and satisfying story.‚Äù* ‚Äî **Aaron A. Reed, author of the [Archives of the Sky](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1850151847/archives-of-the-sky-epic-sci-fi-roleplaying) story game.**

> *‚ÄúGate Watch is an intriguing, distilled world-crafting, story-telling, and role-playing experience in the guise of a simple game. I wouldn't be surprised if some of the principles it is based on are used in basic literary, plot-writing or directing courses. Involve everybody around the table and collaboratively set the background through a pool of questions. Create exciting scenes involving both the background and the participating characters with nothing but narration. Dice? Nah, too random. Cards? Yes, but only a handful. Rules? Less than a single page. Duration? As long as you wish. Fun? Loads! The game can explore any setting and genre you want it to, with everybody simultaneously starring and directing. Veteran gamer? Hardcore role-player? Total newbie? It doesn't matter. All you need is a vivid imagination.‚Äù* **‚Äî Antonios S, RPGnet Reviewer & Columnist (about the 1st edition of Gate Watch).**
