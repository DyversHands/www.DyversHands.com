## Reviewer Quotes

> *"Tableau is a versatile, flexible framework for collaborative storygames grounded deep in the fundamentals of story and character. Mix and match cards to shift what themes, rules, archetypes, and ideas are on the table, helping your group tell a compelling and satisfying story."* — **Aaron A. Reed, author of the [Archives of the Sky](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1850151847/archives-of-the-sky-epic-sci-fi-roleplaying) story game.**

### Types of Stories

We've found the mechanics of ***Tableau*** work well for experienced gamers as well as those who are completely new to collaborative story games. From improv actors to experienced role players, a wide range of people have found the instructions and mechanisms easy to understand and fun to play. The resulting stories were imaginative, the settings and genres intriguing, the play dynamic, and most importantly, all had a satisfying ending in just a couple of hours of play. ***Tableau*** is a fun evening's entertainment.

## What are PlaySets and StorySets?

**PlaySets** are themed collections of story elements designed for specific genres (like cosmic horror, fantasy, or noir). Each PlaySet contains all the rules and components needed to tell stories in that genre.

**StorySets** are curated scenario packages within PlaySets that solve choice paralysis by providing focused story starters. Instead of choosing from dozens of possible story elements, a StorySet gives you a pre-selected combination that creates a specific narrative focus – perfect for new players or quick setup.
