You and your companions are members of the **Gate Watch**—charged to keep an eye on the border between worlds. Who built the gate? What is on the other side? What are you guarding against? These are the questions you will answer.

**Gate Watch** is a diceless, gmless story game for 2-5 players, using 18 poker-sized (2.5” x 3.5”) cards, with rules on front, and inspirational images on back. You will need two sheets of paper, some index cards and some markers.

So far in playtests the Gate has been selected by the players to be a wide variety of places & genres:

- between the real-world and the Greek heaven & hell;
- 1950's noir mystery featuring the gate of a Hollywood producer's mansion;
- a scifi adventure where a collapsing underground mutant civilization have a hidden exit to a post-apocalyptic landscape;
- and a dark fantasy about a well in a German farming village at the end of WWII that may be an escape from invading Russians to the lands of the fae.

Many of the playtesters had not played a gmless cooperative story game before, yet found the instructions & play quite easy. The collaboratively created games were very creative, the play dynamic, and most importantly all had a satistying ending in just a couple of hours of play.

## About the Author

I am fascinated by the art and craft of collaboration, and have its practice and the study of how and why collaboration works at the center of my professional career as an entrepreneur, a software architect, as well as a creator, producer & publisher in the game industry.

In the paper RPG games industry I have been the the owner/publisher of the popular RPG community website [RPGnet](https://www.RPG.net) since 2001. As a creative collaborator I most notably produced Chaosium's [Beyond the Mountains of Madness](https://index.rpg.net/display-entry.phtml?mainid=3005) role-playing game, which won the [Origin's Award](http://www.originsawards.net/) for "Best Roleplaying Adventure" in [1999](https://index.rpg.net/display-search.phtml?key=award&value=Origins+Awards&sort=nosort).

In the board games industry I resurrected the original 1987 edition of [Arkham Horror](https://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/9/9215.phtml) and licensed it in 2005 to Fantasy Flight for its best-selling [2nd edition](https://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/12/12132.phtml) of this board game series.

I am co-author with Shannon Appelcline of ["Meeples Together: How and Why Cooperative Board Games Work",](https://www.MeeplesTogether.com) a book on the practice, design and theory of cooperative games, best exemplified by games like Pandemic, Hanabi, Arkham Horror, and Gloomhaven.  We had a successful [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jefftidball/meeples-together-how-and-why-cooperative-board-gam) in late 2018 and the book will be [available](https://meeples-together.backerkit.com/hosted_preorders) to the public in March of 2019. We are working on a sequel on the topic of collaborative play for publication in 2020.

In the computer games industry, I'm the founder of [Skotos Tech](https://www.skotos.net), an online game company where I was lead for the social Castle Marrach and Lovecraft Country online games, and produce Grendel's Revenge.

With my long-time co-author Shannon Appelcline, I am also the creator & co-author of an upcoming graphic novel Touched, as well as producer of two previous comics associated with our online games: [Lovecraft Country: Return to Arkham](http://www.lovecraftcountry.com/comic/) & [Castle Marrach: Awakenings](http://www.skotos.net/games/marrach/comic/awakenings/awakenings.shtml).

I have been writing about collaboration for several decades. My [Life with Alacrity](https://www.LifeWithAlacrity.com) blog talks about the principles of cooperation, collaboration, and governance while my [Rebooting the Web of Trust](https://www.WebOfTrust.info) workshops imagine the future of collaboration on the internet.

In the last few years I increasingly have been moving away from traditional forms of role-playing such as Call of Cthulhu or Runequest, to forms that are more story-centric and allow for more player control of the game. This game my first attempt to share some of the lessons learned from my recent experiences in role-playing.

I am avid supporter of other games designers on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/christophera/) and [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ChristopherA/).

## Ludology

This story game was first inspired when I was researching various lists of thematic storytelling archetypes: 7 Basic Plots (Booker), 20 Master Plots (Tobias), 36 Dramatic Situations (Polti), 37 Photoplay Plots (Hill), Basic Patterns of Plots (Foster-Harris), Poetics (Aristotle), Shape of Stories (Vonnegut), and the TV Tropes Wiki (dyvers hands).

Though not explictly named by these lists, many of the plot archetypes have binary sides. Good Guy/Bad Guy, Quest/Return, etc. Having recently played the gmless game [The Quiet Year](https://buriedwithoutceremony.com/the-quiet-year) (2013) which made extensive use of a collaboratively created map, I realized that a map with two sides might be a quite powerful plot device. That lead thematically to focusing on a place between the maps — **the gate** — as being an interesting point of play to explore.

This game's next biggest inspiration was when I was looking at pricing at Print-on-Demand cards for another game, and discovered that there were significant price breaks at 18 cards. So I set for myself a goal to create a game only using 18 cards. Given these constraints, one of the first things I realized was having all the backs of the cards be the same was a waste. After several playtests using different inspirational images for the gates on the card backs, this contrained approach has to be quite powerful. If successful, I hope to offer some more 18 card story games.

I have been using for some other of my story games a resolution mechanism inspired by [Archipelago II](https://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2009/07/04/archipelago-ii/) (2009) *(which in turn was derived by [Itras By](https://itrasby.com/) (2008))*, which extends the traditional improv "Yes, and…" with some additional choices.  Having just six such choices, balanced between good and bad, fit well into the constraints of having just 18 cards.

Finally, using the constraint of player questions to define other player's characters rather than player's creating their own characters was inspired by [A Penny for My Thoughts](https://www.evilhat.com/home/a-penny-for-my-thoughts/) (2009), and of course general improv "Yes, and…" practices.

I play a lot of story games, so I'm sure there many other sources of inspiration that influenced this game, but these are the most important ones.

The cards were composited for POD (Print-on-Demand) publishing using Keynote for Macintosh, and the Print-to-Play version was layed-out using Pages for Macintosh. Let me know if you'd like a copy of my raw templates — they both are surpisingly easy to use to create POD games.
